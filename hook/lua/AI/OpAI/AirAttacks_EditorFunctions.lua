local ScenarioFramework = import("/lua/scenarioframework.lua")

--- Some context information:
--- AttackManager -> AM for short
--- PlatoonBuildManager -> PBM for short
--- 'Master' platoons -> AM platoons, formed from multiple 'Child' platoons
--- 'Child' platoons -> PBM platoons that are built by factories
--- Platoon counts usually are: 1, 2, or 3, depending on the difficulty

--- NOTE: This file is used by SCFA's BaseOpAI, which allows customization of what OpAI platoon we want to assemble
--- So, platoon counts can be set by mission creators, but if they are not set, we fall back to some default values instead

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is less than desired.
--- AKA 'Do we need more PBM platoons ?'
--- SCFA's BaseOpAI filters out platoons by allowed 'child' unit types, any unallowed ones' platoon builder is either removed from the PBM, or receive an additional 'False' build condition from MiscBuildConditions.lua

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is more or the same as desired.
--- AKA 'Do we have enough PBM platoons to form the AM platoon ?'
