--- Some context information:
--- AttackManager -> AM for short
--- PlatoonBuildManager -> PBM for short
--- 'Master' platoons -> AM platoons, formed from multiple 'Child' platoons
--- 'Child' platoons -> PBM platoons that are built by factories
--- Platoon counts usually are: 1, 2, or 3, depending on the difficulty

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is less than desired.
--- AKA 'Do we need more PBM platoons ?'
---@param aiBrain AIBrain
---@param master string
---@return boolean

    local num = ScenarioInfo.OSPlatoonCounter[master .. '_D' .. difficulty] or difficulty
	
	return counter < num

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is more or the same as desired.
