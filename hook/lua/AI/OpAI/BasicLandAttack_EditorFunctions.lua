--- Some context information:
--- AttackManager -> AM for short
--- PlatoonBuildManager -> PBM for short
--- 'Master' platoons -> AM platoons, formed from multiple 'Child' platoons
--- 'Child' platoons -> PBM platoons that are built by factories
--- Platoon counts usually are: 1, 2, or 3, depending on the difficulty

--- NOTE: This file is used by SCFA's BaseOpAI, which allows customization of what OpAI platoon we want to assemble
--- So, platoon counts can be set by mission creators, but if they are not set, we fall back to some default values instead

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is less than desired.
--- AKA 'Do we need more PBM platoons ?'
--- SCFA's BaseOpAI filters out platoons by allowed 'child' unit types, any unallowed ones' platoon builder is either removed from the PBM, or receive an additional 'False' build condition from MiscBuildConditions.lua

    local difficulty = ScenarioInfo.Options.Difficulty or 3
    local number = ScenarioInfo.OSPlatoonCounter[master .. "_D" .. difficulty] or difficulty
	
    return counter < number
end

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is more or the same as desired.
--- AKA 'Do we have enough PBM platoons to form the AM platoon ?'
---@param aiBrain AIBrain default_brain
---@param master string default_master

    return counter >= number
end

--- Checks if the OpAI platoon has the 'Transports' functionality enabled, returns true if its origin base has less than 5 transports in its unique transport pool
--- AKA 'Am I allowed to build transports, if so, do I have enough of them ?'
--- NOTE: The functionality can be enabled by using the 'OpAI:SetFunctionStatus(funcName, bool)' on an OpAI instance, example: OpAI:SetFunctionStatus('Transports', true)
