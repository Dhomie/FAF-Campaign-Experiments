local ScenarioFramework = import("/lua/scenarioframework.lua")

--- Some context information:
--- AttackManager -> AM for short
--- PlatoonBuildManager -> PBM for short
--- 'Master' platoons -> AM platoons, formed from multiple 'Child' platoons
--- 'Child' platoons -> PBM platoons that are built by factories
--- Platoon counts usually are: 1, 2, or 3, depending on the difficulty

--- The corresponding 'save.lua' has been slightly changed
--- InstanceCounts for T2 Child platoons have been increased from 1 to 2, this should result in larger naval fleets

--- Generic Child platoon count build condition that returns true if the amount of child platoons existing is less than desired.
--- AKA 'Do we need more PBM platoons ?'
--- NOTE: This was originally coded to set fleetNum to 1 in all cases, changed it to the default platoon count
