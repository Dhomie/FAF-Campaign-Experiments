--- Some context information:
--- 'Master' platoons -> AM platoons, formed from multiple 'Child' platoons
--- 'Child' platoons -> PBM platoons that are built by factories
--- Changed platoon counts to the default 1/2/3, previously it was 1/1/1 naval fleet, and 1/2/3 sub fleets 

--- InstanceCounts for T2 Child platoons have been increased from 1 to 2, this should result in larger naval fleets

--- AKA 'Do we need more PBM platoons ?'
--- NOTE: This was originally coded to set fleetNum to 1 in all cases, changed it to the default platoon count
